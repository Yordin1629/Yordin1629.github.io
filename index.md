Hello, my name is Yordin Aguilar, and I'm a computer science major at CSUF. I plan on graduating in 2028.

## My Favorite Labs from CPSC 120L

* Lab 6, part 2

This lab was one of my favorites of the year, if not even one of my favorites. In this lab, it was all about blackjack. I enjoyed it so much because I remember playing blackjack with my friends. This lab's main learning object was using if statements and bools. It was one of the labs that had a heavier emphasis on them.


* Lab 10

The second lab I enjoyed this year was lab ten, which included the population of California by county. The learning objective of this lab was to figure out how to organize the data using vectors. I enjoyed this lab because it was challenging in a good way. I’ve had a hard time understanding vectors, but this lab helped me understand them better.


* Lab 12

The third lab that I enjoyed was lab twelve. During this lab, the main goal was to make an image. The main focus of this lab was the introduction to Magick::ColorRGB. This is something new that was introduced to the class. With the Magick::ColorRGB, we can produce color. This is something that interests me as it’s something that I might want to learn more about.
